# Welcome to disCHORD!

## About

Our app, disCHORD, aims to connect people across the globe through the power of music. The app allows you to search an artist or title, links to Spotify for listening to music with friends, and offers a chat feature for texting while listening! Additionally based on a chatgpt like search you can find matches based on keywords.

Originally developed for UCLA's CS35L course

## Features

Here’s a brief list of disCHORD’s most notable features:

Authenticated Login: Authenticate users for secure access to the app. Supports cross-device login.

Search Using Keyword: Users can search for an artist or track title, and the app will return song matches. 

Music: disCHORD includes a feature that based on search we link tracks to Spotify, so users can listen to the track there. This allows for users to play and chat simultaneously.

Chat: Users can search for users by username and chat with each other. Each chat sets up its own chatroom that allows for realtime communication.

Noteworthy (Song Recommendations) iFrame: A fun feature where you can type in a song name, and the search will return similar songs and a confidence level.
